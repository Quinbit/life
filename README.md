# life

This is a simple c++ implementation of Conway's game of life. It uses curses to help make the interface as simple as easy to use as possible. To run, simply execute the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Quinbit/life.git
make
./a.out
```

This should run the game. It is recommended that you increase the terminal window size as much as possible to ensure that none of the screen gets cropped out. The game can load different boards, save them, run them in real time, and manually edit them if you so choose.
